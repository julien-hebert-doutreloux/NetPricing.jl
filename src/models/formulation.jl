Abstract type of all formulations
A Formulation must define:
- problem(form): the overall problem (not the commodity problem)
- primal(form): primal representation
- dual(form): dual representation
- append!(model, form): add formulation to the model
- calculate_bigM(form): return a matrix whose row a corresponds to bigM candidates of arc a (order in a1)
- objective_term(form): term to add to the objective function
